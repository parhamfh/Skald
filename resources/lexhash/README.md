This file was used to test the phonetic lexicon I received from Jonas Beskow.
Unfortunately it did not fulfill my requirement and could not be used to
translate the words of my text, instead the TTS shell on csc.kth.se is used.
The lexicon did not contain all the words I believe, some of which were very
common words, and neither was there an easy way to find a word with a
different stem than found in the lexicon. All this extra parsing of a 
possibly, and most likely, incomplete lexicon made me opt for the remote 
transcribing through the TTS shell on csc.kth.se.

Very unfortunate.
